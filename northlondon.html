	<h2>I want to go to more plays!</h2>
	<div>
    A great north London theatre I've been to recently is the Almeida theatre in islington. A small theatre, located just off upperstreet, it has a huge kudos in theatre world. 
    
    They do great ticket offers including 500 £5 tickets, available if you're under 25 for every play. And £15 ticket offers for the under 30's as well as a range of other deals if you live locally. 
     
    Check it out here <a href="https://almeida.co.uk/">

    <h2>I looking for a great pizza place...any suggestions?</h2>
    <div>

    Well if you have been London for any length of time, you may have come across the pizza chain Franco manca <a href="http://www.francomanca.co.uk" > Originally starting as a single restaurant hidden away in Broxton it has now spread across London and you can find several newly opened Franco’s in Stoke Newington, Kentish town and Muswell Hill.

    For something a little more niche, why not head to the newly opened L’antica pizzeria da Michele     <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/damichelelondon/">  –Only the second restaurant opened outside of its     ative Naples and also Julia Roberts’ main love interest in the movie eat-pray-love, this pizza  is Bellissimo!

    <h2> I want to connect more with nature – are there any parks I could check out? </h2>
    <div>
     There are so many fabulous open spaces in North London just waiting to be explored.
     I can’t recommend Hampstead heath enough. It’s hilly terrain features ponds, woodland walks, wonderful views across London and even an English heritage House – Kenwood House <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/kenwood/?utm_source=Google%20Business&utm_campaign=Local%     20Listings&utm_medium=Google%20Business%20Profiles&utm_content=kenwood%20house">   – at one end. 
     Also checkout Primrose Hill, and waterlow park at the top of Highgate hill is lovely spor.
