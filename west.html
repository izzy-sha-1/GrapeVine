	  <h1>West London</h1>
	   <div class="container">
	    <br>
	    <p><b>I have a friend’s wedding coming up and still haven’t found anything to wear. Where can I get something??</b></p>
	  <div>Easy- Westfield’s! It is HUGE. You are bound to find something in the many shops. Some are more on the pricier side but you still have the more affordable high-street chains. There’s also places to eat too if shopping all day tires you out. I love it there. However, it can get super busy so try and avoid peak times.
	  </div>
	    <br>
	    <p><b>I have some super energetic kids to tire out over the Easter holidays. Any ideas welcome</b></p>
	  <div>I know the pefect thing. There is the <a href="http://oxygenfreejumping.co.uk">Oxygen Freejumping's</a> trampoline park in North Acton. The place caters to all ages and even holds birthday parties. I took my 8 year old the other week and he is already asking to go back!
	  </div>
	    <br>
	    <p><b>With these random bursts of sunshine I'm getting excited for summer. Anything on in the summer months for me to look forward to?</b></p>
	  <div>Yes! Lots! One option is Notting Hill Carnival which is a celebration of London's Carbibean Communities, cultures and traditions taking place on August bank holiday. It defintely rivals Gay Pride as a fun and bright festival. I would advise keeping a little poncho with you in case though. I got soaked the other year, but still had fun!
	  </div>
	    <br>
	  <div>Ah thanks for the info! What about anywhere in the West that would be good to visit on any weekend around summer? Carnival sounds good just far away!
      </div>
	    <br>
	    <p>If you're looking for somewhere to go on the weekend, Portobello Market is a great day out. I have wasted hours away looking at the stall and trying all the different cuisines. Also if you get there in about the last half hour if it closing up, everything is reduced
