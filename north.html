			<p><b> I would like to go to the theatre more but I don't know where to begin - can you recommend any good theatres? </b></p>
         			 <div>A great north London theatre I've been to recently is the Almeida theatre in Islington. Although a small theatre, located just off upperstreet, it has  big kudos had some huge hits that have transferred to the west end such as George Orwells's 1984 last year. huge kudos in theatre world.

       		         <p><b> I'm looking for a great pizza place...any suggestions?</b></p>
         			<div> Well if you have been London for any length of time, you may have come across the pizza chain  <a href="http://www.francomanca.co.uk">Franco Manca</a> Originally starting as a single restaurant hidden away in Broxton it has now spread across London and you can find several newly opened Franco’s in Stoke Newington, Kentish town and Muswell Hill.

         			<div>For something a little more niche, why not head to the newly opened <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/damichelelondon/"> L’antica pizzeria da Michele </a> –Only the second restaurant opened outside of its native Naples and also Julia Roberts’ main love interest in the movie eat-pray-love, this pizza  is Bellissimo!

       	  			<div>There are so many fabulous open spaces in North London just waiting to be explored.
         			I can’t recommend Hampstead heath enough. It’s hilly terrain features ponds, woodland walks, wonderful views across London and even an English heritage House , <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/kenwood/?utm_source=Google%20Business&utm_campaign=Local%     20Listings&utm_medium=Google%20Business%20Profiles&utm_content=kenwood%20house"> Kenwood House </a>   – at one end. A wonderful place to explore for a day out.
