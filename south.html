						<div>
							God I know! It gets to me too. I would recommend Kew Gardens for a little escape. I went at Christmas time when they had a really cool light display but I would say it is well worth a visit any time of year! There’s so much going on yet it still feels like a calm retreat from the hustle and bustle of city life. If you are a big fan of flowers you can go on the website (http://www.kew.org): there’s a cool section dedicated ‘what to see this week’.

					<p><b>I would love to go to a Shakespeare production but don’t want to have to fork out a tonne of money for it. The cheaper seats are always so far way! I want to be able to get a good look at the action!</b></p>
						<div>
							Heya. Have you considered screening of plays? I am a convert. You can watch a great performance on much comfier cinema seats and not be judged for munching on popcorn either! I recently went to watch a screening of ‘The Twelfth Night’ from the National Theatre but I know there is a screening coming up in Clapham on 6th April. Adult tickets are about £20 and kids half the price at £10.

					<p><b>My parents are coming to stay and I want to take them somewhere a bit special for food to show off London (though on a student’s budget this proves almost impossible). Please give ideas of places to visit that will impress!</b></p>
						<div>
							Ok so this place is slightly more central than South but it’s well worth the trip. Last week I went to Kouzu for a fancy Japanese style afternoon tea. It was so tasty and such a refreshing spin on the generic English afternoon tea. Even better, I found a deal on Groupon and got the whole thing for half the price. Always a good idea to check deals on Groupon as you can save so much.

						Ah yes I have been here too! Its such a good deal, would definitely recommend. I was looking at booking afternoon teaat Fortnum & Mason's in the next few weeks for a colleagues retirement party. Anyone been?
