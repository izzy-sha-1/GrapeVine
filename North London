       <b>I want to connect more with nature – are there any parks I could check out? </b>
    <div>
     There are so many fabulous open spaces in North London just waiting to be explored.
     I can’t recommend Hampstead heath enough. It’s hilly terrain features ponds, woodland walks, wonderful views across London and even an English heritage House , <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/kenwood/?utm_source=Google%20Business&utm_campaign=Local%     20Listings&utm_medium=Google%20Business%20Profiles&utm_content=kenwood%20house"> Kenwood House </a>   – at one end. A wonderful place to explore for a day out.
