    <div>

    Well if you have been London for any length of time, you may have come across the pizza chain  <a href="http://www.francomanca.co.uk">Franco Manca</a> Originally starting as a single restaurant hidden away in Broxton it has now spread across London and you can find several newly opened Franco’s in Stoke Newington, Kentish town and Muswell Hill.

    For something a little more niche, why not head to the newly opened <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/damichelelondon/"> L’antica pizzeria da Michele </a> –Only the second restaurant opened outside of its native Naples and also Julia Roberts’ main love interest in the movie eat-pray-love, this pizza  is Bellissimo!

    <h2> I want to connect more with nature – are there any parks I could check out? </h2>
    <div>

     There are so many fabulous open spaces in North London just waiting to be explored.
     I can’t recommend Hampstead heath enough. It’s hilly terrain features ponds, woodland walks, wonderful views across London and even an English heritage House , <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/kenwood/?utm_source=Google%20Business&utm_campaign=Local%     20Listings&utm_medium=Google%20Business%20Profiles&utm_content=kenwood%20house"> Kenwood House </a>   – at one end. A wonderful place to explore for a day out.
